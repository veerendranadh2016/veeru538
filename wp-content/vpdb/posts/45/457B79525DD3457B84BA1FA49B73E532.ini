Each container in a pod has its own image. Currently, the only type of image supported is a <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerimages/\">Docker Image</a>.

You create your Docker image and push it to a registry before referring to it in a kubernetes pod.

The <code>image</code> property of a container supports the same syntax as the <code>docker</code> command does, including private registries and tags.
<h2><a id=\"user-content-updating-images\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4b60e4892fc3d9d593214afbcb79ca3e28301d7e/docs/images.md#updating-images\"></a>Updating Images</h2>
The default pull policy is <code>PullIfNotPresent</code> which causes the Kubelet to not pull an image if it already exists. If you would like to always force a pull you must set a pull image policy of <code>PullAlways</code> or specify a <code>:latest</code> tag on your image."
